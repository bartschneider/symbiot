## Problem Statement & Current State

### Core Problem
Our current web scraping system suffers from **fundamental architectural mismatches** that prevent it from functioning as intended, while the broader challenge is the **manual, time-intensive nature of knowledge discovery** from web content.

### Technical Issues (Immediate)
1. **API Mismatch**: Frontend expects Firecrawl-style API, backend provides session-based wrapper
2. **Missing Proxy Routes**: `/api/v1/convert`, `/api/progress/*`, `/api/info` endpoints not implemented
3. **Request Structure Incompatibility**: Frontend sends simple requests, backend expects complex metadata
4. **Double API Prefix Bug**: BASE_URL + endpoint creates malformed URLs
5. **Progress Tracking Mismatch**: Different path patterns for progress monitoring

### Business Pain Points (Strategic)
1. **Manual Research Bottleneck**: Users spend hours manually analyzing scraped content
2. **Hidden Relationships**: Connections between entities and concepts remain buried in text
3. **Knowledge Silos**: Information exists in isolation without contextual relationships
4. **Scalability Limits**: Current approach doesn't scale beyond basic content extraction
5. **Limited Insights**: No automated analysis or pattern recognition capabilities

### Current Architecture Analysis

**Existing Components**:
```

                       └──────────────────┘
```

**What's Working Well**:
- ✅ **React Frontend**: Modern, responsive UI with excellent user experience
- ✅ **Firecrawl Service**: Production-grade scraping with Playwright, JWT auth, rate limiting
- ✅ **PostgreSQL Integration**: Solid database foundation for metadata storage

**What's Broken**:
- ❌ **Go Backend Proxy**: Unnecessary complexity causing API mismatches
- ❌ **Three-Service Coordination**: Deployment and integration challenges
- ❌ **Limited Functionality**: Only basic scraping without knowledge processing

### Impact Assessment
- **User Frustration**: Current system non-functional due to API errors
- **Development Velocity**: API mismatches block feature development
- **Business Value**: Potential insights locked in unprocessed content
- **Competitive Disadvantage**: Manual processes while competitors may use automated analysis
- **Resource Waste**: Significant development effort trapped in broken architecture

### Root Cause Analysis
The fundamental issue is **architectural mismatch** rather than implementation problems:
1. Frontend designed for direct Firecrawl API access
2. Backend implements session-based wrapper without API compatibility
3. No clear evolutionary path to knowledge graph capabilities
4. Over-engineering of proxy layer for simple scraping use case

### Strategic Solution Approach
1. **Preserve Valuable Assets**: Maintain the excellent React UI and production-grade Firecrawl service
2. **Eliminate Architectural Complexity**: Remove the problematic Go proxy layer
3. **Enable Evolutionary Growth**: Create clear path from scraper to knowledge platform
4. **Optimize for Scale**: Perfect architecture for internal tool requirements

### Data Architecture

**PostgreSQL Schema** (Metadata & Operations):
```sql
-- Job management and processing tracking
jobs (id, type, status, created_at, completed_at, metadata)
users (id, email, role, created_at, preferences)
content_sources (id, url, type, last_scraped, status)
extraction_sessions (id, user_id, source_url, status, metadata)

quality_metrics (id, content_id, entity_count, relationship_count, confidence_score)
```

**Neo4j Schema** (Knowledge Graph):
```cypher
// Entity nodes with properties and classifications
(:Person {name, title, organization, confidence_score, source_urls[]})
(:Organization {name, type, industry, location, confidence_score, source_urls[]})
(:Concept {name, category, description, confidence_score, source_urls[]})
(:Content {url, title, summary, processed_at, source_type})

// Relationship types with context and confidence
(:Person)-[:WORKS_FOR {since, title, confidence}]->(:Organization)
(:Organization)-[:COMPETES_WITH {market, intensity, confidence}]->(:Organization)
(:Concept)-[:RELATED_TO {strength, context, confidence}]->(:Concept)
(:Content)-[:MENTIONS {context, sentiment, confidence}]->(:Entity)

#### Implementation Steps

**I1.1: Immediate Fix Implementation** ✅ COMPLETED
Based on research findings, implement chosen approach:

**Option A: Direct Frontend-Firecrawl Connection** (Implemented)
